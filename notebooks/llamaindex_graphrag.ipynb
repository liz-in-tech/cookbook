      "Vivo X90s Officially Teased, Tipped to Run on New MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC:Vivo X90s has been teased by Jia Jingdong, Vivo's Vice President and General Manager of Product Strategy via Weibo on Thursday. The new smartphone has a design similar to its Vivo X90 series siblings — Vivo X90 and Vivo X90 Pro. The Vivo X90s is shown to have a Zeiss-tuned triple rear camera unit. The upcoming model is expected to retain the key specification of the Vivo X90. Meanwhile, Chinese tipsters have leaked the specifications of the upcoming handset. The Vivo X90s is said to run on MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC and could be offered in four different colour options.\n",
      "Jia Jingdong posted an image of the Vivo X90s on the Chinese microblogging platform providing us a glimpse of the design from the rear. The render shows the handset in a white finish with rounded corners. The image suggests Zeiss branded triple rear cameras on the rear panel along with an LED flash. It seems to have a glass back with the Vivo branding at the bottom.\n",
      "Vivo, however, didn't confirm the exact launch date or key specifications of the Vivo X90s.\n",
      "Separately, several Chinese tipsters posted specifications of the upcoming Vivo X90s on Weibo. According to the tipsters, the handset will be powered by the latest MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC. This would be an upgrade over the MediaTek Dimensity 9200 SoC found on the vanilla Vivo X90. The new model is said to offer Wi-Fi 7 connectivity and could be offered in black, blue, green, red, and white colour options. The Vivo X90, in contrast, has Wi-Fi 6 and is available in China Red, Ice Blue, and Original Black (translated from Chinese) in China.\n",
      "A TENAA listing from May revealed the specifications of the Vivo X90s. As per the listing, it will have a 6.78-inch 1.5K (1,280 x 2,800 pixels) curved AMOLED display. The screen has a centre-aligned hole-punch cutout at the top. It is listed to carry up to 16GB of RAM along with up to 1TB of inbuilt storage.\n",
      "Oppo, OnePlus, Realme to Operate as Separate Entities in India: Report\n",
      "The triple rear camera setup of the handset could include a 50-megapixel main camera sensor, accompanied by a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 12-megapixel portrait sensor. It is said to pack a 32-megapixel selfie camera as well. Vivo is expected to provide a 4,690mAh battery on the Vivo X90s.\n",
      "The Vivo X90 Pro has finally made its debut in India, but is the company's flagship smartphone for 2023 equipped with enough upgrades over its predecessor? We discuss this and more on Orbital, the Gadgets 360 podcast. Orbital is available on Spotify, Gaana, JioSaavn, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, Amazon Music and wherever you get your podcasts.\n",

      "Epic’s latest tool can animate hyperrealistic MetaHumans with an iPhone:Today, Epic is releasing a new tool designed to capture an actor’s facial performance using a device as simple as an iPhone and apply it to a hyperrealistic “MetaHuman” in the Unreal Engine in “minutes.” The feature, dubbed MetaHuman Animator, was detailed at the Game Developers Conference in March but is now available for developers to try out for themselves. Epic has also released a new video today produced by one of its internal teams to show what the tool is capable of.\n",
      "While Epic’s short film shows off some impressively subtle facial animation, the big benefit the company is emphasizing is the speed with which MetaHuman Animator produces results. “The animation is produced locally using GPU hardware, with the final animation available in minutes,” the company’s press release reads. That has the potential to not just save a studio money by making performance capture more efficient but also, Epic argues, it could allow them to experiment and be more creative.\n",
      "“Need an actor to give you more, dig into a different emotion, or simply explore a new direction?” Epic’s press release asks. “Have them do another take. You’ll be able to review the results in about the time it takes to make a cup of coffee.” Facial animation can be applied to a MetaHuman character “in just a few clicks,” Epic says, and the system is even smart enough to animate a character’s tongue based on the performance’s audio.\n",
      "Performance capture using iPhones has been possible in the Unreal Engine since at least 2020 with the launch of Epic’s Live Link Face iOS app, but now, it’s combined with the high level of detail promised by Epic’s MetaHuman technology. As well as working on the iPhone 12 and up (which is capable of capturing both video and depth data), Epic says MetaHuman Animator can also be used with “existing vertical stereo head-mounted camera [systems] to achieve even greater fidelity.”\n",
      "Epic says the Blue Dot short film released today should give some idea of what its animation tool is capable of. It was produced by Epic Games’ 3Lateral team and stars actor Radivoje Bukvić delivering a monologue based on a poem by Mika Antić. Although Epic says it’s possible to tweak animation post-capture, it claims “minimal interventions” were made on top of the MetaHuman Animator’s performance capture to achieve these results.\n",
      "If you want to learn more, Epic has released an instructional video on how to use the tool. Documentation is also available via the MetaHuman hub on the Epic Developer Community.\n",

      "Ryanair sacks chief pilot over sexual misconduct claims:Reuters\n",
      "Ryanair has sacked its chief pilot after an investigation into his alleged sexual harassment of female colleagues.\n",
      "The airline told staff that he had been fired for \"a pattern of repeated inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour towards a number of female pilots\".\n",
      "The chief pilot, named in reports as Aidan Murray was appointed in 2020 and had been with the airline for 28 years.\n",
      "Ryanair declined to comment \"on queries relating to individual employees\".\n",
      "According to The Independent, Mr Murray allegedly harassed nine junior colleagues, including sending text messages to some with comments on their bodies.\n",
      "Mr Murray, 58, is also accused of altering flight rosters to fly with certain female pilots.\n",
      "In a note to staff, Ryanair's chief people officer, Darrell Hughes, said Mr Murray's employment had been \"terminated with immediate effect\".\n",
      "An investigation found his behaviour \"was in breach of our anti-harassment policy\". Ryanair said staff should be able to come to work \"in a safe and secure environment\".\n",
      "\"We would ask all of you to respect the privacy and integrity of those brave individuals who came forward to assist us in this investigation,\" Mr Hughes added.\n",
      "The Financial Times reported that Mr Murray has seven days to launch an appeal against his dismissal.\n",
      "The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Murray for comment.\n",
      "The job of chief pilot is an important one. The holder is both a highly qualified airline captain and a manager, responsible for overseeing other pilots based at a hub airport.\n",
      "They are usually in charge of issues such as training, flight coordination and rostering as well as addressing personal issues. They can also represent the airline in disciplinary issues.\n",
      "As such, they have a lot of power over their fellow pilots, particularly more junior ones seeking promotions.\n",
      "The suggestion that someone in this position might be abusing their power - and behaving in an \"inappropriate and unacceptable\" way towards female staff - is therefore a very serious charge.\n",
      "It's important to note that we haven't heard the other side of the story. But it appears that whistleblowers have come forward - and have been listened to.\n",
      "Against that background, the dismissal should come as no surprise.\n",
      "A report last year by the Royal Aeronautical Society into discrimination and lack of diversity in airline pilot training found \"extremely concerning\" reports of sexism and sexual harassment by many female pilots.\n",
      "Although many had positive comments on their training, reports of sexism and harassment ranged from \"banter\" to \"uncomfortable advances from male trainers\".\n",

      "Dáil almost suspended after Sinn Féin TD put pager in front of Minister during firefighters debate:The Dáil was almost suspended on Thursday afternoon after Sinn Féin TD John Brady walked across the chamber and placed an on-call pager in front of the Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien during a debate on retained firefighters.\n",
      "Mr O’Brien said Mr Brady had taken part in “an act of theatre” that was “obviously choreographed”.\n",
      "Around 2,000 retained firefighters around the country staged a second day of industrial action on Tuesday and are due to start all out-strike action from next Tuesday. The mostly part-time workers, who keep the services going outside of Ireland’s larger urban centres, are taking industrial action in a dispute over pay and working conditions.\n",
      "Speaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin deputy leader Pearse Doherty said firefighters had marched on Leinster House today and were “very angry” at “the fact the Government will not intervene”.\n",

      "Dáil almost suspended after Sinn Féin TD put pager in front of Minister during firefighters debate\n",

      "Taoiseach ‘propagated fears’ farmers forced to rewet land due to nature restoration law – Cairns\n",
      "“An intervention is required now. I’m asking you to make an improved offer in relation to pay for retained firefighters,” Mr Doherty told the housing minister.\n",
      "“I’m also asking you, and challenging you, to go outside after this Order of Business and meet with the firefighters because they are just fed up to the hilt in relation to what you said.\n",
      "“Some of them have handed in their pagers to members of the Opposition and have challenged you to wear the pager for the next number of weeks, put up with an €8,600 retainer and not leave your community for the two and a half kilometres and see how you can stand over those type of pay and conditions.”\n",
      "At this point, Mr Brady got up from his seat, walked across the chamber and placed the pager on the desk in front of Mr O’Brien. Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said the Sinn Féin TD was “completely out of order” and told him not to “carry out a charade in this House”, adding it was “absolutely outrageous behaviour and not to be encouraged”.\n",
      "Mr O’Brien said Mr Brady had engaged in “an act of theatre here today which was obviously choreographed” and was then interrupted with shouts from the Opposition benches. Mr Ó Fearghaíl said he would suspend the House “if this racket continues”.\n",
      "Mr O’Brien later said he said he was confident the dispute could be resolved and he had “immense regard” for firefighters. The minister said he would encourage the unions to re-engage with the State’s industrial relations process while also accusing Sinn Féin of using the issue for their “own political gain”.\n",
      "“You see what happened here today, you’re shameless and people see through it,” he told Mr Doherty.\n",
